# STATUS.md - CentralReach Integration

---

**Project:** CentralReach API Integration
**Last worked on:** January 27, 2026
**Path:** `~/dev/CR`

---

## Current Status

**Overall:** Exploratory - researching API capabilities

---

## What I Just Did

- [x] Researched CentralReach API documentation
- [x] Documented authentication flow (OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens)
- [x] Identified available API domains (Clients, Employees, Scheduling, Billing)
- [x] Outlined potential integration ideas for hospital internal tools

---

## What's Next

- [ ] Identify who at hospital can request API access **START HERE**
- [ ] Decide which use case to pursue first
- [ ] Request API credentials (5-7 day turnaround)
- [ ] Build proof-of-concept once credentials obtained

---

## Blockers / Questions

- **Blocker:** No API credentials yet - need CR organization admin to request access
- **Question:** Who at the hospital has CR admin access?

---

## Notes for Next Session

This is exploratory for potential hospital internal tools. Ideas include:
1. ScatterplotCreator sync (pull client list from CR)
2. Scheduling dashboard
3. Data export/reporting
4. Mini-apps integration

API docs saved in `~/dev/CR/docs/`
